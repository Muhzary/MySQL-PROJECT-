# Assignment: Data Import and Analysis

## Dataset Choice

I chose the **Netflix Shows** dataset for this assignment. This dataset contains information about various shows available on Netflix, including details like the title, director, cast, country of production, release year, rating, and genre.

## Import Process

To import the dataset into MySQL Workbench, I followed these steps:

1. Downloaded the dataset in CSV format.
2. Opened MySQL Workbench and created a new schema for the project.
3. Used the "Data Import/Restore" feature in MySQL Workbench to import the CSV file into a new table.
4. Ensured that the data types of the columns matched the data contained within them.

### Difficulties Faced

One difficulty I encountered was that some of the columns had missing values, which caused issues during the import process. To resolve this, I adjusted the column data types and handled null values appropriately.

## Interesting Observation

An interesting observation I made while exploring the Netflix Shows dataset is that a significant portion of the content available on Netflix is produced in the United States, followed by India. This reflects Netflix's strategy of targeting large markets with diverse content.
